jobflucli
=========

    A Go application for browsing the JobFluent public feed through a
    terminal using an UI that ressembles the UI of other terminal
    applications such as Mutt.

    Looking desperately for a job to pay your bills, but you don't want
    to give up on your fancy desires to use a terminal at all times?
    Want to sneak out what's going on around you but you don't want to
    open suspicious tabs on your work computer?  This app is for you,
    my friend.
